In the above representation, each player is presented with buttons to input their choice. The game proceeds as follows:

Both players choose one of the three options: "rock," "paper," or "scissors" by pressing their button of choice.
Once both players have made their selection, the choices are revealed simultaneously.
The outcome of the game is determined by the following rules:

Rock beats scissors (Rock crushes scissors)
Scissors beats paper (Scissors cut paper)

# Bugs.

only bugs is in game area when the buttons are pressed they spread out then in again due to the rock image being sized different to the rest and unfortunately I couldn't figure it out.

 The images in the game area appear as normal until a selection is made, they then disappear however the game continues to function as intended despite that.
