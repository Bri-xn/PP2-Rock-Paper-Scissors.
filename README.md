Both players choose one of the three options: "rock," "paper," or "scissors" by pressing their button of choice.
Once both players have made their selection, the choices are revealed simultaneously.

# Bugs.

only bugs is in game area when pressed they spread out then in again due to the rock image being sized different to the rest and unfortunately I couldn't figure it out.


# Comments & Credits.

due to critical errors and folders corrupted i had to scrap the project and start from scratch last night.

I used chatgbt to figure out the correct solution for the transition between the title screen and the game screen.
